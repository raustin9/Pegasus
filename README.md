# Yet Another Engine
The purpose of this project is to create a generic rendering engine template that can be cloned and used to create a basic cross-platform (Windows & Linux) application with a basic event handler. It will open a window with a vulkan context ready to render on, so I don't have to create a new one (a lot of work) every time that I want to make a new application.
